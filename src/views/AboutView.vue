      <p>Hi! My name is Phillip. I'm a full stack software developer with a big passion for music. I got into coding during my bachelor's degree in "Digital Concept Development".
        I have a love/hate relationship with coding - meaning that I hate it when the code doesn't work. I'm sure the majority of coders have a similar feeling.
        When I finally get the code to work, I feel like on top of the world. It's a very euphoric feeling.
      </p>

        I get the same feeling whenever I'm playing music. It's quite the addicting feeling. In terms of coding I'm especially passionate about front-end development.
        I guess it's because it incorporates creativity and logical design. I always feel very proud of myself whenever I'm able to create something looks amazing.
